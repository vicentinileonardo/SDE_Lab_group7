For M1/M2 users or whoever does not want to use the VM:

In order to follow the lab, you will need:

- A web browser: Chrome preferably

- A code editor: Visual Studio Code preferably

- NodeJS version 16.15.1 or more recent 
(https://nodejs.org/it/download/)
Note: an older version could probably still work but it's not guaranteed because we haven't tested it

- Git

- The lab repository cloned on your machine (https://github.com/vicentinileonardo/SDE_Lab_group7)
(git clone git@github.com:vicentinileonardo/SDE_Lab_group7.git)


Once the repository is cloned: 
- move inside the repo: cd SDE_Lab_group7/
- install all the dependencies: npm install
- start the servers : npm run dev

At this point you should be able to see in the terminal that 2 servers are ready on ports 3000 and 4000
